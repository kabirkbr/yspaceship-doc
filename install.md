# Installing

ySpaceShip is a Docker container therefore in principle should run on any operating system where Docker is supported. In practice however it uses components outside Docker (e.g. system's PDF viewer) therefore certain customization for full functionality is still needed. Current version supports Ubuntu Linux (tested on 14.04 and 16.04) and Windows (10 Pro).
